# Overview
This is my final year project for Singapore Polytechnic in 2021. My other projects are currently private because they're still in development with friends, and Iâ€™m careful about sharing unfinished work publicly. I hope this project gives you a clear idea of my skills and coding style in the meantime. Thanks for understanding!

# Note
This project is dated and requires Unity 2019.4.10f1 to run in editor. It may not work in newer versions of Unity due to changes in the engine. I recommend using the specified version for the best experience. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.
